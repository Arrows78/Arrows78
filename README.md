### 👋 Hello there!

I'm Thomas — a French Product Manager based in Paris 🇫🇷, who loves to build.

By day, I craft user experiences and solve meaningful problems through product. By night (or weekend), I’m diving into code, automating workflows, and building random tools that make life easier (or just more fun).
I'm not a full-time developer, but I love to code, learn, and challenge myself.

**🧠 Spare time:** 🛠️ Building apps to boost productivity • ⚙️ Automating processes with scripts & no-code tools • 🧪 Exploring new tech and learning things • 📦 Managing my setup like a product (*dotfiles, Brew bundles, ...*)

**🧰 Tools & toys I like to play with:** `Raycast` • `Shell` • `Make` • `Slack Bots` • `Homebrew` • `Notion` • and more...

I'm always up for connecting with other makers, product folks, or anyone into automation and creative workflows.

**Feel free to star, fork, or drop me a message — let’s build cool stuff 🚀**
