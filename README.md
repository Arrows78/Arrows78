### 👋 Hello there!

I'm Thomas — a French Product Manager based in Paris 🇫🇷, who loves to build.

By day, I craft user experiences and solve meaningful problems through product.  
By night or weekend, I’m diving into code, automating workflows, and building random tools that make life easier (or just more fun).

I'm not a full-time developer, but I love to code, learn, and challenge myself. Whether it's building small apps, scripting automations, or just geeking out with new tools — I'm all in.

**🧠 What I enjoy doing in my spare time:**

- 🛠️ Building apps to boost productivity and streamline daily life
- ⚙️ Automating processes with scripts & no-code tools (*Make and Raycast are part of my playground*)
- 😄 Writing funny scripts that do things nobody asked for (*but I needed them anyway*)
- 🧪 Exploring new tech and learning how things work under the hood
- 📦 Managing my setup like a product (*dotfiles, Brew bundles, ...*)

**🧰 Tools & toys I like to play with:**

`Raycast` • `Shell` • `Make` • `Slack Bots` • `Homebrew` • `GitHub Actions` • `Notion` • and more...

I'm always up for connecting with other makers, product folks, or anyone into automation and creative workflows.

**Feel free to star, fork, or drop me a message — let’s build cool stuff 🚀**
